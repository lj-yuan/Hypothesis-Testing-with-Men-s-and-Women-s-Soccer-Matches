# Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-s-and-Women-s-Soccer-Matches

### Project Description
Time to begin applying your statistical testing skills to historical data of men's and women's international soccer matches!

You'll be working as a sports journalist at a major online sports media company, specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. You'll perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than in men's.
