# Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-s-and-Women-s-Soccer-Matches

### Project Description
Use statistical testing skills to historical data of men's and women's international soccer matches! Perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than in men's.

#### The question for this project is: 

Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?

Assume a 10% significance level, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:

 H0: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.
 
 H1: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.
